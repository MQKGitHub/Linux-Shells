### 🛡️ Linux Shells

**Room:** [Linux Shells — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxshells)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *15 May 2025*  

### 🎯 Objective
This room introduced the fundamentals of Linux shells, covering different shell types, basic commands, and shell scripting. The goal was to understand shell interaction, compare popular shells (Bash, Fish, Zsh), and develop practical scripting skills for automation.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- **Shell Types** — Comparison of Bash (default), Fish (user-friendly), and Zsh (feature-rich) shells  
- **Basic Commands** — Essential commands like `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `grep`, and `cat`  
- **Scripting Fundamentals** — Variables, loops, conditional statements, and comments in shell scripts  
- **Shebang** — `#!/bin/bash` directive specifying the interpreter  
- **Permissions** — Using `chmod +x` to make scripts executable  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Bash** — Default shell for scripting exercises  
- **Text Editors** — `nano` for creating and editing scripts  
- **Command Utilities** — `grep` for pattern searching, `chmod` for permissions  
- **Shell Comparison** — Explored features of Fish and Zsh shells  

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Transitioning from GUI to CLI mindset for file operations  
- Remembering correct syntax for conditional statements in scripts  
- Debugging script errors without IDE support  
- Overcame by:  
  - Practising with simple scripts first  
  - Testing scripts in small sections  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to navigate and manipulate filesystems using shell commands  
- The differences between popular Linux shells and their use cases  
- Scripting constructs like variables (`$var`), loops (`for`), and conditionals (`if-else`)  
- Importance of shebang lines and execution permissions  
- Practical applications of `grep` for log analysis  
- How to create an authentication script with user input validation

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Shell proficiency is essential for Linux administration and security work:
> - **System Administration**: Automating repetitive tasks with scripts  
> - **Incident Response**: Quickly searching logs with `grep`  
> - **Penetration Testing**: Writing custom exploitation scripts  
> - **DevOps**: Creating deployment and maintenance scripts  
> The locker script exercise demonstrated practical access control implementation.

### 💭 Reflections:
- Most valuable: Understanding shell scripting logic and flow control  
- Most surprising: Advanced features of alternative shells (Fish/Zsh)  
- Key insight: "Mastering shells transforms CLI from a basic tool to a powerful automation platform"  
- Practical benefit: Ability to quickly parse and analyse log files
